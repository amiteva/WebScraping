# Web Scraping
The main goal of this task is to extract information from a given website (https://www.basketball-reference.com/).
The program takes the name of an NBA player as a command-line argument and prints out his 3-pointers average for each given season.

### Example:

#### Input:
```
Luka Donćić
```
#### Output:
```
2018-19 8.0
2019-20 9.5
2020-21 8.2
```
This Java web scraper was built with Maven and implemented using the Jsoup library.
### Automated Testing
